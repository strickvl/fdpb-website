                            <p>M. Kabir Mohabbat was born in Kabul, Afghanistan. He was reared in a politically active Pashtun family. At 18 his family sent him to the United States for higher education. Only days before the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Kabir graduated from Southeastern Missouri State University with a degree in Political Science. Soon thereafter, he left the U.S. to fight for Afghanistan as a mujahid. Years later he became a businessman in Houston, Texas. In the 1990's, when the U.S. State Department needed a bridge to the new Afghan government -- the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (the Taliban) -- Kabir volunteered to help.</p>
                            <p>Kabir is the co-author of <em>Delivering Osama: The Story of America's Secret Envoy.</em></p>

                            <p>Mohammad Tahir Aziz Gumnam worked at a hospital in Pakistan during the 1980s war helping wounded mujahedeen. Originally from Kandahar, he wrote two books about the 1980s war entitled 'Kandahar Assassins' and 'Kandahar Heroes'. Published in 1986 in the Pashtu language and a perennial classic in Kandahar's bookstores, Kandahar Assassins tells the story of two well-known assassins who operated in the southern city during the 1980s war. The stories of 'Lame Ghazi' and Commander Ghaffari involve ambitious raids and plots carried out within the Afghan-controlled city. 'Kandahar Heroes', published ten years later, is a sequel incorporating biographical portraits of a number of fighters and commanders. Gumnam died in Herat City in 2012.</p>
                            <p>Gumnam is the author <em>Kandahar Assassins</em> and <em>Kandahar Heroes</em>.</p>
